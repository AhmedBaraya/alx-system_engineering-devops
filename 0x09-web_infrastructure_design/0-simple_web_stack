### Simple Web Stack for www.foobar.com

#### Infrastructure Design:

1. **User Request**:
   - The user wants to access the website www.foobar.com.
   - They enter this domain name into a web browser.

2. **Domain Name System (DNS)**:
   - DNS translates the domain name (www.foobar.com) into the IP address of the server.
   - The type of DNS record is an A record.
   - The IP address of the server is 8.8.8.8.

3. **Server**:
   - The server hosts all the infrastructure components.
   - The server receives requests from the web server.

4. **Web Server (Nginx)**:
   - Nginx receives HTTP/HTTPS requests from users.
   - It directs the requests to the application server for processing.

5. **Application Server**:
   - The application server runs the website code.
   - It receives requests from Nginx and processes them.

6. **Application Files**:
   - The code files that are written for the website.
   - They are executed on the application server.

7. **Database (MySQL)**:
   - The MySQL database stores the data required for the website.
   - The application server communicates with the database to retrieve or store data.

#### Explanation of Components:

- **Server**: A computer that provides services to other computers on the network.
- **Domain Name**: An easy-to-remember address that users enter to access the website instead of an IP address.
- **DNS Record (www)**: The type of record is an A record that links the domain name to the IP address.
- **Web Server (Nginx)**: Receives requests from users and directs them to the application server.
- **Application Server**: Runs the code and processes the requests coming from Nginx.
- **Database (MySQL)**: Stores the data that the website needs, such as user information.

#### Issues with this Infrastructure:

- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: If the server goes down, the entire website becomes unavailable.
- **Downtime for Maintenance**: When maintenance is needed on the server, the website will be down during this period.
- **Scalability**: A single server may not be able to handle a large number of visitors at the same time.
