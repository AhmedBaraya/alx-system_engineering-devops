## Scaled-Up and Secure Web Infrastructure (www.foobar.com 

**Start**

**Client-Side (Multiple Clients):**

* Client 1 sends an HTTPS request.
* (Optional) More clients (Client 2, Client 3, etc.) send HTTPS requests.

**Internet:**

* HTTPS requests travel through the internet.

**Firewall (Web):**

* Filters incoming traffic to web servers, blocking malicious requests.

**Load Balancers (HAproxy Cluster):**

* (Step related to Firewall) Receives filtered traffic from the web firewall.
* (Redundancy) Operates in a cluster configuration for fault tolerance.
* Distributes HTTPS requests across available web servers using a Round Robin algorithm (or other configured method).

**Web Servers (Nginx - x2):**

* (Step related to Load Balancers) Receives a request from a load balancer.
* Retrieves content from the application server.
* Delivers web pages to clients.

**Application Servers (x2):**

* (Step related to Web Servers) Processes the request using the application codebase.
* Interacts with the database for data retrieval (reads) or updates (writes).

**Database Server (MySQL):**

* (Step related to application server actions)
    * For reads: Provides data to the application server.
    * For writes: Receives updates from the application server and stores them.

**Response to Client:**

* Web server delivers the generated web page to the client that initiated the request.

**Monitoring Clients (x4):**

* Continuously collect performance data from all servers and load balancers.
* Send collected data to a monitoring service (e.g., Sumo Logic) for analysis.

**End**

**Notes:**

* This flowchart highlights the core process flow, including security (firewalls) and monitoring aspects.
* Steps related to each other (client requests, web firewall filtering, load balancer distribution, web server reception) are placed side-by-side to show their concurrent nature.
* Redundancy in the load balancer cluster is emphasized.

**Additional Considerations:**

* A database cluster with multiple master nodes can be implemented for write redundancy.
* Additional security measures like application firewalls can be added.
