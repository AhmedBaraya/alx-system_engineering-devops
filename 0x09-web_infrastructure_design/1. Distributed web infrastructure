## Flowchart: Distributed Web Infrastructure with Security and Monitoring (www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed])

**Start**

**Client-Side (Multiple Clients):**

* Client 1 sends an HTTP request.
* (Optional) More clients (Client 2, Client N) send HTTP requests.

**Internet:**

* HTTP requests travel through the internet.

**Load Balancer (HAproxy):**

* Receives HTTP requests from clients.
* (Step related to 2 above) Distributes traffic evenly using a Round Robin algorithm (or other configured method).
* Sends requests to available web servers.

**Web Servers (Nginx - x2):**

* (Step related to 3 above) Receives a request from the load balancer.
* Retrieves content from the application server.
* Delivers web pages to clients.

**Application Servers (on Servers 1 & 2):**

* (Step related to 4 above) Processes the request using the application codebase.
* Interacts with the database for data retrieval (reads) or updates (writes).

**Database (MySQL):**

* (Step related to application server actions)
    * For reads: Provides data to the application server from the Replica node (if configured).
    * For writes: Receives updates from the application server and stores them on the Master node.

**Response to Client:**

* Web server delivers the generated web page to the client that initiated the request.

**Security Considerations (Optional):**

* Firewall (not currently implemented): Filters incoming and outgoing traffic to block potential attacks.
* HTTPS (not currently implemented): Encrypts communication between clients and servers for secure data transmission.

**Monitoring Considerations (Optional):**

* Monitoring tools (not currently implemented): Track server health, application performance, and potential issues.

**End**

**Notes:**

* This flowchart highlights the core process flow and includes optional security and monitoring considerations.
* Steps related to each other (client requests, load balancer distribution, web server reception) are placed side-by-side to show their concurrent nature.
